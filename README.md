# Hugo's Blog

This is the repository that houses my blog and personal website. It runs [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (I know, I know, it has a very cool name).

It uses the [TBD](https://github.com/hugomd/blog/tree/develop/themes/simple) theme (of my own making) and is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Running locally
```
hugo server
```

### Static Assets
Hosted assets are stored in [`/content`](./content), and get served on `/`, e.g. `/about.json`.
