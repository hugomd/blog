            <p>Torrenting. Is it illegal? Not necessarily. Is it legal then? That depends.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, torrents are used to share any number of files to friends or just people on the internet. The way this works is, if I send you a torrent so you can download 200 of my photos, that leaves you and me &lsquo;seeding&rsquo; (uploading/sharing). Then, if you pass on the torrent to &lsquo;John&rsquo;, he will download from both of us. What this means is that his speed will be increased because we are both &lsquo;seeding&rsquo; for him. Now, let&rsquo;s say you start download a set of 20GB files with 2000+ &lsquo;seeders&rsquo; (people who are sharing), although 20GB is a lot, the download speed could get up to 30 to 50 MB/s (this depends on your network speed).</p>

<p>In short, torrenting allows for fast downloads of any number of different files.</p>

<p><strong>The Do&rsquo;s</strong></p>

<p>If you are downloading illegal torrents, its generally best to use a private torrent site. These sites often provide faster downloads and a guaranteed upload speed meaning that, no matter what files you&rsquo;re downloading, you&rsquo;ll be able to download them quickly. The second, and most important, reason to use a private torrent site is that they&rsquo;re &lsquo;trackers&rsquo; (these track how many people are uploading or download) are secure meaning that you, most likely, won&rsquo;t be caught. The best feature of private torrent sites is that they are virus free.</p>

<p>Scan the files you&rsquo;ve downloaded before extracting them (if they do happen to be zipped), you don&rsquo;t want a nasty virus. Viruses normally come from public torrent websites where malicious users want to feel like they&rsquo;re getting back at society.</p>

<p>Check the files you&rsquo;re downloading before you download them. Before you start downloading a torrent, in most torrent clients, a box will pop up showing you the files that are being downloaded. You&rsquo;ll want to look at these carefully to make sure you&rsquo;re downloading what you intended.</p>

<p>Check the comments. This is a must when using public torrents. This is where other users will comment on the quality of the torrent, be it video, audio or something else. They&rsquo;ll also comment with they&rsquo;re dislike upon finding out that the torrent contained viruses or that it wasn&rsquo;t what they thought it was, i.e. they tried downloading a movie that hadn&rsquo;t been released and were surprised to find it wasn&rsquo;t the movie they intended to download.</p>

<p><strong>The Don&rsquo;ts</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t download anything illegal. Although anyone reading this will likely not be paying attention to the legality of what they&rsquo;re downloading, they should be aware of the consequences. The downloading illegal or copyrighted material can lead to a fine of up to 250,000 USD or a jail sentence of up to 5 years.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t try to download the latest and greatest. The chances are it&rsquo;ll be filled with viruses or will be of horrible quality. Wait until a few weeks (or months) after the movie has been released, then you&rsquo;ll be sure to get DVD rip or Bluray copy.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t post about it on Facebook. Firstly, no one cares. Secondly, it makes it easier for the police to find you.</p>

<p>If you follow the above when torrenting, you should be alright.</p>

<p><em>I do not endorse the download of illegal or copyrighted material.</em></p>
