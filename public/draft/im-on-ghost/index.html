            <p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://tryghost.org/">Ghost</a> now. I&rsquo;ve followed the project quite closely since it&rsquo;s Kickstarter but missed the opportunity to back it (one of those &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll back it later&rdquo; moments).</p>

<p>So far, so good. It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s simple and the idea of putting markdown and a preview of said markdown side by side, although not something new, has never been done in a blogging platform before (or if it has, I don&rsquo;t know about it).</p>

<p>What do I intend to post here? That&rsquo;s a very good question, probably exactly what I&rsquo;ve posted on the other, various iterations, of my blog. I&rsquo;ll probably repost some of my favourite blog posts, that I&rsquo;ve written. And then I&rsquo;ll post as I do normally, except this time I&rsquo;ll have more time to do so, free of the stress of school. Freedom has arrived.</p>

<hr />

<p>####Tweaks
I&rsquo;ve made a little addition to Ghost&rsquo;s default theme, Casper, by adding Google+ comments to it. Thanks to <a href="http://bioselemental.com/ghost-adding-google-comments/">Bios Element</a> it was pretty easy. I&rsquo;ve used it before, in <a href="https://shortkey.in/">Shortkey</a> and just needed a little reminder!</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s next? Hopefully making my own theme (after exams, of course) and maybe making a few backend tweaks after diving into NodeJS. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<hr />

<p>####Why Ghost is the next Big Thing
It&rsquo;s new, had the support of over 5 thousand backers and raised nearly 8 times it&rsquo;s goal of Â£25 thousand. Evidently it has the support of many, and Kickstarter has allowed backers to beta test the platform while also suggesting new features. Ghost has been released to the public with an already thriving community and doesn&rsquo;t need to grow (although it indubitably will). Next up in the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/ghost/wiki/Roadmap">Roadmap</a> we&rsquo;ll be seeing support for plugins and a range of new features, and there&rsquo;s already support for themes.</p>

<p>Ghost will continue to grow, being picked up by more developers and bloggers. It&rsquo;s new, it&rsquo;s fancy and it stands out among the old timers like WordPress and Joomla. That&rsquo;s not to discredit WordPress or Joomla, but to point out that both have, at least WordPress has, outgrown their initial purpose while Ghost has a clear goal.</p>
