                    <p><a href="http://unihack.net/">UNIHACK Melbourne</a> is a Melbourne-based hackathon that was run last weekend (August <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>) and is open to all university and TAFE students in Victoria.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve heard <em>lots</em> about hackathons, particularly the ones run in the USA, and the amount of creative potential they seem to unleash. You hear the stories about how Facebook Video and Chat <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=238358730483">emerged from hackathons</a>. This, for me, sounded exciting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An opportunity to stand out from the crowd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I come up with a fair few ideas every month but, most of the time, I don&rsquo;t have the courage to pursue them, having had failed projects in the past along with the feeling that comes with working on a project for too long (and not making much progress). This hackathon presented an opportunity for me to build something quickly, just a prototype, and an opportunity to stand out from the crowd. The reason I say this could make me stand out is that I&rsquo;ve always felt like a stock-standard programmer - I have experience to do things but, when I browse Github or code that my colleagues write, I feel that I lack the skill they do.</p>

<p>UNIHACK, like many hackathons, centred itself around a theme, &lsquo;discovery&rsquo;, which made it easier to narrow down what I wanted to build. I came up with the idea for <a href="http://craft.lc/">Craft!</a> about a week before the hackathon began and that week felt like forever, I felt super eager to get started.</p>

<p>I gained a number of new skills at the hackathon, not ones that might be particularly useful working in the real world, but would help me achieve personal goals.</p>

<p>The first thing I learned was to time manage, right from the start. I spent a good few hours trying to get a specific part of the code working and, as always, it was one line of code that fixed it. I tend to do this with exams and assignments, where I get stuck on a question for too long and don&rsquo;t move on.</p>

<p>Secondly, I found that it&rsquo;s far better to build a simple prototype, completely lacking in features but with one main component (the main idea). Initially, my plan was to build a Minecraft server automator (&lsquo;one-click&rsquo;) with a number of tiered plans (hourly pricing). I thought I could crank out a bunch of features in a short amount of time. I was wrong. I&rsquo;m not trying to discourage anyone reading this, and to clarify, I was working with Python (easy, right?), which I learned a month ago. I was also using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> framework, which I hadn&rsquo;t touched until a day before the hackathon.</p>

<p>The third thing I learned is probably the most important - share your ideas. I came into the hackathon intent on keeping my idea to myself, that I would be sharing it a couple days later anyway, everyone could wait. This is entirely the wrong approach. Think about it. You&rsquo;re at a hackathon with a bunch of other like-minded people. They think like you but not <em>exactly</em> like you - so, of course, they could <em>add</em> to your idea. They might even want to <em>help you work on it</em>. At a hackathon, sharing will help you flesh out your idea and make new friends.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one will put you down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about who wins the hackathon (if anyone wins) - the judges are not there so much to criticise but to provide feedback that might help your product function in the real world.</p>
