&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-monash-ninja&#34;&gt;What is Monash Ninja?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://monash.ninja&#34;&gt;Monash Ninja&lt;/a&gt; was week-long treasure-hunt-like event (14 Sept. to 21 Sept. 2015) run by &lt;a href=&#34;http://wired.org.au/&#34;&gt;Wired Monash&lt;/a&gt;. The concept and code was created by &lt;a href=&#34;http://hugo.sx/&#34;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; (then Vice President) and the design for the website was created by &lt;a href=&#34;http://terencehuynh.com/&#34;&gt;Terence&lt;/a&gt; (then Secretary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased the &lt;em&gt;monash.ninja&lt;/em&gt; domain in April 2015 on a whim and then decided to come up with an idea for it. I had been thinking it would be fun for Wired to run a treasure hunt but thought it would be difficult to find participants as treasure hunts require effort for the hunters, but also for the organisers. This lead me to the idea of putting up (read: hiding) codes around campus (with help from Terence) that could then be entered on a website. Easy participation, a &amp;ldquo;keep your eyes peeled&amp;rdquo; approach, rather than actively looking for clues, and fairly easy implementation and organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;design-and-implementation&#34;&gt;Design and Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monash Ninja consists of a simple HTML + JQuery/Ajax + CSS frontend with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://flask.pocoo.org&#34;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; + MySQL backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database contained 30 codes and had the following schema:
- code_id INT&lt;br /&gt;
- code VARCHAR&lt;br /&gt;
- used BOOL&lt;br /&gt;
- student_id INT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API was super simple:
- /all - JSON of entire database (only for local use)&lt;br /&gt;
- /get - given a code and a student ID, validates the code and returns success/failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in seeing the code, it&amp;rsquo;s on the Wired Monash Github, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wiredmonash/monash.ninja&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poster design:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.hugo.sx/longterm/K4ENY.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website design:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.hugo.sx/longterm/udf9y.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prizes were worth over $500 as a result of &lt;a href=&#34;http://unihack.net/&#34;&gt;UNIHACK&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s success:
- 16x MSA vouches ($15 ea.)&lt;br /&gt;
- 4x Google Cardboard ($20 ea.)&lt;br /&gt;
- 10x iTunes Gift Vouchers ($30 ea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;end-result&#34;&gt;End Result&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week 26 of the 30 codes had been found and validated, of which around 2 were ripped down, presumably by university staff. To remedy this, we hid these two in the source code of wired.org.au and monash.ninja. Most of the prizes were collected on the following Monday after the event. Some participants were unable to collect their prizes and scheduled alternative times, while others did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with the success of Monash Ninja and hope that it can continue to be run each year under the Wired Monash banner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Terence for putting up with my stupid questions, helping me distribute and hide the codes, give out the prizes and for allowing me to sticky tape a ninja code to his back for the duration of the club&amp;rsquo;s Annual General Meeting (AGM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-would-i-do-next-time&#34;&gt;What would I do next time?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find an easier way to keep track of people. Specifically, taking emails, or using Facebook login, instead of just a student ID and code - it would have made it a little easier to notify people they&amp;rsquo;d received a prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Store more information on the database: whether prizes have been given out, website feedback, and general statistics such as how many codes validated each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-will-monash-ninja-return&#34;&gt;When will Monash Ninja return?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully next year! &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Maybe during O-week?? (hint hint)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I learned at UNIHACK Melbourne</title>
      <link>https://blog.hugo.sx/post/what-i-learned-at-unihack-melbourne/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.hugo.sx/post/what-i-learned-at-unihack-melbourne/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://unihack.net/&#34;&gt;UNIHACK Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; is a Melbourne-based hackathon that was run last weekend (August &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) and is open to all university and TAFE students in Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; about hackathons, particularly the ones run in the USA, and the amount of creative potential they seem to unleash. You hear the stories about how Facebook Video and Chat &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=238358730483&#34;&gt;emerged from hackathons&lt;/a&gt;. This, for me, sounded exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opportunity to stand out from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come up with a fair few ideas every month but, most of the time, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the courage to pursue them, having had failed projects in the past along with the feeling that comes with working on a project for too long (and not making much progress). This hackathon presented an opportunity for me to build something quickly, just a prototype, and an opportunity to stand out from the crowd. The reason I say this could make me stand out is that I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt like a stock-standard programmer - I have experience to do things but, when I browse Github or code that my colleagues write, I feel that I lack the skill they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNIHACK, like many hackathons, centred itself around a theme, &amp;lsquo;discovery&amp;rsquo;, which made it easier to narrow down what I wanted to build. I came up with the idea for &lt;a href=&#34;http://craft.lc/&#34;&gt;Craft!&lt;/a&gt; about a week before the hackathon began and that week felt like forever, I felt super eager to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gained a number of new skills at the hackathon, not ones that might be particularly useful working in the real world, but would help me achieve personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I learned was to time manage, right from the start. I spent a good few hours trying to get a specific part of the code working and, as always, it was one line of code that fixed it. I tend to do this with exams and assignments, where I get stuck on a question for too long and don&amp;rsquo;t move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I found that it&amp;rsquo;s far better to build a simple prototype, completely lacking in features but with one main component (the main idea). Initially, my plan was to build a Minecraft server automator (&amp;lsquo;one-click&amp;rsquo;) with a number of tiered plans (hourly pricing). I thought I could crank out a bunch of features in a short amount of time. I was wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to discourage anyone reading this, and to clarify, I was working with Python (easy, right?), which I learned a month ago. I was also using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://flask.pocoo.org/&#34;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; framework, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched until a day before the hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third thing I learned is probably the most important - share your ideas. I came into the hackathon intent on keeping my idea to myself, that I would be sharing it a couple days later anyway, everyone could wait. This is entirely the wrong approach. Think about it. You&amp;rsquo;re at a hackathon with a bunch of other like-minded people. They think like you but not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like you - so, of course, they could &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; to your idea. They might even want to &lt;em&gt;help you work on it&lt;/em&gt;. At a hackathon, sharing will help you flesh out your idea and make new friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one will put you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about who wins the hackathon (if anyone wins) - the judges are not there so much to criticise but to provide feedback that might help your product function in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
