I’m still living in Melbourne, Australia, although I’m staying at home because of Corona virus.

I’m working on Bitcoin things at [Cash App](https://cash.app).

In my spare time, I’m building apps that make use of [Lightning](https://lightning.network), like an [invoice generator for accepting ⚡️ tips](https://github.com/hugomd/lnd-invoice) and a [Discord bot for tipping other users](https://github.com/hugomd/odin).

Given we’re in lockdown, I’ve also been [playing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) [games](https://bethesda.net/en/game/doom) without the usual guilt associated.

I’m still fascinated by [Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) despite reading it some time ago.

My most recent obsession has been dialling in my espresso, drawing inspiration from [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk).
