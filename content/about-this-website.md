title: "About this website"
---

This blog is built with a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (I wrote about this [here](/post/moving-to-cloudflare-pages/)).

My domain was purchased through [host.md](https://host.md/) (previously Molddata), I think this is the main registrar for `.md` domains.

I manage DNS for `hugo.md` via Cloudflare.

I write my posts in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and push them to my [blog repository](https://github.com/hugomd/blog) on GitHub, where they are automatically deployed.
