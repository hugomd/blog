Despite using [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) with [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for a few years, I've only recently found out about `:Ag` which lets you perform searches across your folders and files.

Until now, I never realised that you can use `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` to select multiple files, then press `Ctrl + T` to open them in a new tab, with a quicklist. From there you can navigate between items in the quicklist using `:cn` and `:cp`.

Here's a video demonstration:

Neat, right?
