I've made a few tweaks to my blog theme, so it now adapts to changes to the
macOS system theme. I believe this works across operating systems, although
your browser may not support it yet!

Here it is in action:

<video controls width='100%' autoplay>
	<source src='./output.mp4' type='video/mp4'>
	Your browser doesn't support the HTML5 video tag :(
</video>
