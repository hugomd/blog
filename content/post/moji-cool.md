A couple of weekends ago (06/05 to 07/05), [Nathan Malishev](https://twitter.com/NathanMalishev), [Josh Parnham](https://twitter.com/joshparnham), [Daniel Sykes-Turner](https://twitter.com/dsykesturner), and I attended the Facebook Melbourne [Hackathon](https://facebook.com/hackathon) ‚Äî located in Facebook‚Äôs beautiful and [brand new office](https://twitter.com/search?f=images&vertical=default&q=%23fbmelhack17). 

Our team, ‚Äò[Moji](https://moji.cool)‚Äô, ended up taking home first prize ‚Äî a trip to San Francisco to compete in the Facebook Global Hackathon finals. 

We built an end-to-end product, [moji.cool](https://moji.cool/), consisting of a dashboard, a Chrome extension and an [embed](https://demo.moji.cool/), which allow end users to react to any web page they come across. 

The idea was to take what Facebook has done with their [reactions](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/02/reactions-now-available-globally/) but allow _anyone_ to react to _any_ website they come across. The embedded version is similar to Disqus‚Äô comments or the Facebook üëç button, you embed it and anyone who visits your site can use it. The Chrome extension adds this functionality to all websites you visit and allows you to react to them.

As with most hackathons, our idea evolved pretty quickly once we started implementing it, so we ended up adding live visualisations of reactions as users interact with the page, in the form of a stream of emoji following a randomised sin wave (thanks to [Daniel](https://twitter.com/dsykesturner)). Here it is in action:
