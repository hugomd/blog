I've made a few changes to this blog's theme over the last few weeks, and I thought it would be nice to summarise them in a post.

Here's what has changed:

- Add support for {{<sidenote "post translations" 1 >}}You can see this in action [here](/fr/post/this-blog-is-decentralised/).{{< /sidenote >}}
- Remove the link to the {{< sidenote "git SHA in the footer" 2 >}}I doubt anyone was using this, and it's obsolete with a link to edit on GitHub.{{< /sidenote >}}
- Increase font size _everywhere_
- Use [Newsreader](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader) for body text
- Use <span class="functional">[Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin)</span> as the functional text
- Use <span style="font-family:pragmatapro;"><a href="https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/">PragmataPro</a></span> for code
- Post metadata (date, tags, etc) now uses functional font
- Increase line-height and decrease site width
- Add an “Edit on GitHub” link to each post
- Add [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

I was inspired to make typography changes after reading [Kev](https://kevq.uk/)’s post: [What's In A Font? Website Typography Best Practices](https://kevq.uk/whats-in-a-font-researching-website-typography/).
