Today, I acquired a new domain name. It's two letters short.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Launch control, this is Houston, we are go for launch! 🚀 <br><br>👉 <a href="https://t.co/NzHGcMp5Px">https://t.co/NzHGcMp5Px</a><br><br>👉 <a href="https://t.co/IaUwr3xnX3">https://t.co/IaUwr3xnX3</a> is live! 🚀 <a href="https://t.co/xh9pJBRxHc">pic.twitter.com/xh9pJBRxHc</a></p>&mdash; Hugo 👨‍💻 (@hugojmd) <a href="https://twitter.com/hugojmd/status/803574701662474240">November 29, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm pleased with it. Short, succinct, concise, small.

A two letter domain is something I've wanted for a _long_ time, and I'm excited to finally have one.

I'll use my new found <s>power</s> domain only for good, I promise!
