Today, I acquired a new domain name. It's two letters short.

{{< statictweet "803574701662474240" >}}

I'm pleased with it. Short, succinct, concise, small.

A two letter domain is something I've wanted for a _long_ time, and I'm excited to finally have one.

I'll use my new found <s>power</s> domain only for good, I promise!
