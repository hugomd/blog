_BrÃ©f: where I try to explain something briefly._

This weekend (9 to 11 Dec.), I competed in the [Telstra Cloud Hackathon](http://constructnow.io/), in a team with three friends ([Gabriel](https://twitter.com/Gaburyeru), [Terence](https://twitter.com/terencehuynh), and [Daniel](https://twitter.com/dsykesturner)).

We built _*Jift*_, a product recommendation engine that uses your friends' Facebook likes to recommend products, along with a (unbuilt) Secret Santa component.

Our hack used ReactJS on the frontend, with some _very_ messy data-binding (courtesy of yours truly, but it's a hack! ðŸ˜³), HapiJS and PostgreSQL on the backend, along with Googleâ€™s Prediction API to map people's interests (via Facebook likes) to products (via Ebay).

We finished the hack with a _beautiful_ and _working_ frontend, but ran out of time to train Googleâ€™s Prediction API. 

I had an amazing time, surrounded by great friends and hackers. Thanks everyone â€“ I'll be back next year!
