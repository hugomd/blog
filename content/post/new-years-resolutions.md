title: "On New Year's Resolutions"
---

I think it's great that people have New Year's resolutions - it's awesome to decide to start doing something, or change they way you're doing something for the new year. 

Having said that, it's silly that people start on January 1st - why not any other date in the year? It's not like anyone's stopping you from starting any other time.

Here are my New Year's Resolutions:
- Aim to take a photo every day.
- Blog more. Expressing your thoughts clearly is important in life, as I was reminded this year (2015).
- Do more. Say yes to lots of things, even if they don't sound so great. Get involved.
- Sleep more, ideally sleep early and wake early. Maybe even something like [this](https://www.producthunt.com/live/jack-dorsey#comment-202069)
