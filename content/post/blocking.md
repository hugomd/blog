I always find writing like walking up an endless flight of stairs and, as you reach the thousandth stair, using every ounce of energy to pull at your legs to move up just one more stair. Obviously I'm exaggerating, or using a bad metaphor, but what I mean is I have a hard time writing. I don't think I'm *bad* at writing; I was a surprisingly good English student, I just .. struggle.   

The issue I've always had has been blocking. I'm not sure if that's the correct term for it but I end up hitting a wall, or a series of taller and taller hurdles. The first one, I jump over easily and the next, and the next, and so on until.. I'll be in the middle of a sentence and I'll just .. *backspace* *backspace* .. I'll delete words, or I'll find myself looking for the perfect word which I'll never end up finding.  

I'll stop my train of thought mid sentence, and maybe even loose it in the process, and think of the perfect next word, mostly looking for synonyms. Now, I could just use a thesaurus but that probably wouldn't help.  

Why am I writing this blog post? Well, I hope that it might help me figure things out, work out why I always seem to cut myself off. I mean, all of that creative potential just gets botched halfway through. It's also nearly midnight and I can't sleep.  

Bye.
