Email has always been something that I've needed to keep track, something that since in the back of my mind and something that I feel like I'm always worrying about. When I receive an email, it normally means I have to *do* something, and I think that's always been the issue.

Early last year I made the switch from Gmail to FastMail (one of the best decisions I've made so far) but it's taken me till now to setup proper rules to sort every single email into folders and memorise all of the keyboard shortcuts. 

I can safely say that now I'm all set up, going _fast_ with FastMail and have rules sending emails into their proper folders, I feel less stressed and more in control. 

We tend to underestimate how email affects our lives.
