**Note: This blog post is a work in progress, I'm working on recording sound snippets of what each board sounds like, as well as adding photos**.

### Vortex Poker II
I started my foray into mechanical keyboards in February of 2014, shortly after building my first custom PC.

After doing a little research, and falling into the rather deep rabbit hole that is the hobbyist's world of mechanical keyboards, I came across the small, and portable, Poker II. After carefully consulting my friend [Will](http://will.sx) about which switch types to get, I went with Cherry MX Reds, a standard for a lot of gamers, and a good choice for those not wanting to end up hating their board if they don't like their switches. There's not a lot to love for Reds, but not a lot to hate either.

Little did I know, that this would be just the beginning of a long list of purchases, a lot of joy, and ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°.

### Leopold FC700R
My second purchase came a few months later, in July of 2014, after convincing myself that I would love the sound of Cherry MX Blues (which I do), and purchasing a Leopold FC700R, a creamy white Korean-made keyboard with textured keys.

### Realforce 87UB SE1700
October of 2014 marked the presiding era of Topre. From this point on, my favourite switches have been Topre, for their concise tactile bump to begin with, followed by an almost immediate and linear fall off, and for the almost pebble-like harmony made by typing on them.

### Realforce 87U-55 SE08T0
Not yet satisfied with my first purchase, which was variable (to my initial dismay), I made purchased another 87U, this time with 55 g uniform switches, which have a much more pronounced actuation, and allow for easy resting of the hand on the keys without actuation.

### Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro II (HHKB Pro II) PD-KB400WN
Madly in love with Topre, I decided it was time to be able to use Topre switches on the go, and purchased an HHKB Pro II in October of 2014.

### 22kbd MX-Mini Winkeyless Korean Custom
In January of 2015, I started hankering more and more for a Korean custom board, that beautiful shiny aluminium body, with vintage Cherry MX Brown switches, and the [alluring pictures](http://22kbd.com/141) of the board finally pushed me to the limit, and I made the purchase.

### Realforce 108UG-HiPro YK0100
This is my latest board, purchased in July of 2015, and was a purchase based on a few things: my love for Topre, the HiPro keycaps, and my love of Topre (I really love Topre).
