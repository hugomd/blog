*This was originally posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/localz-engineering/kubernetes-traefik-locally-with-a-wildcard-certificateNaNe5255d).*

As a passionate software engineer at Localz, I get to tinker with fancy new tools (in my own time) and then annoy my coworkers by evangelising said tools in the workplace. Kubernetes is just one of those tools, and we‚Äôre currently exploring it for use internally! üêô

Here‚Äôs a little tutorial I‚Äôve whipped up for getting Kubernetes up and running on your Mac, and deploying some small services.

### Overview
1.  Installing Kubernetes
2.  Installing `dnsmasq` to route our DNS locally and handle traffic for the¬†`.local` extension
3.  Provisioning a certificate with `mkcert`
4.  Setting up Traefik to handle our service routing
5.  Creating a demo deployment & testing out what we‚Äôve just done

### Installing Kubernetes

Download [Docker for Mac Edge](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/edge-release-notes/), which allows you to enable Kubernetes in just a single click! At the time of writing, Kubernetes hasn‚Äôt made it to a _stable_ release yet.

Once you‚Äôve installed Docker for Mac Edge, open up preferences, navigate to the _Kubernetes_ tab, check _Enable Kubernetes_ and select _Kubernetes_ as your orchestrator, then hit _Apply_!

It might take a few minutes for Kubernetes to start up, so in the mean time go grab a coffee or a nice glass of red! üç∑

Once Kubernetes has installed successfully we‚Äôll need to switch to the correct context:

```
kubectl config use-context docker-for-desktop
```

Running `kubectl get nodes` should give you the following:

```
NAME                 STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
docker-for-desktop   Ready     master    17m       v1.10.3
```

### Installing `dnsmasq`

Next we‚Äôll install `dnsmasq` so that we can redirect any requests to¬†`.local` directly to our local Kubernetes cluster, while leaving other requests intact!

To install:

```
brew install dnsmasq
```

Open up `/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf` and append this line to it:

```
address=/k8s.local/127.0.0.1
```

The above will redirect all¬†`.local` traffic to `127.0.0.1` but you could use any IP and any domain name extension you'd like.

Now start `dnsmasq`:

```
sudo brew services start dnsmasq
```

Next we‚Äôll create a new resolver to handle all of those queries:

```
sudo mkdir /etc/resolver
```

And create a new file at `/etc/resolver/dev` with the following contents:

```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```

Set your DNS to `127.0.0.1` in System Preferences > Network > Advanced > DNS. Don‚Äôt worry, this won‚Äôt null route you as we‚Äôve set a fallback to Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1`).

Flush your DNS for good measure:

```
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

Now if you `dig` a¬†`.local` domain locally, you'll find it redirects to `127.0.0.1`!

```
dig k8s.local @127.0.0.1

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> k8s.dev @127.0.0.1

```

### Using [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/) to create a local certificate authority

First install `mkcert`:

```
brew install mkcert
```

Then we can install the trusted Certificate Authority:

```
mkcert --install
```

Now we can provision a wildcard certificate for our new local domain:

```
mkcert '*.k8s.local'
```

This will create two files: `_wildcard.k8s.local-key.pem` and `_wildcard.k8s.local.pem`.

Finally, we can create a Kubernetes secret to store the newly created certificate:

```
kubectl -n kube-system create secret tls traefik-tls-cert --key=_wildcard.k8s.local-key.pem --cert=_wildcard.k8s.local.pem
```

### Setting up¬†Traefik

_Note: normally you‚Äôd want to separate things into different namespaces, but for brevity I‚Äôll just be using `kube-system`._

First, we‚Äôll apply the `ConfigMap` resource. Let‚Äôs create file called `configmap.yml` with the following contents:

{{< gist hugomd 09c8b65f71133663e8c871bee52fe3f9 >}}

This will make `traefik.toml` configuration file available to the Traefik container. With `[kubernetes]` enabled, it will look for [Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) entries and make them available publicly.

Apply `configmap.yml`:

```
kubectl apply -f configmap.yml
```

Now we can deploy Traefik, creating `deployment.yml` and applying it:

{{< gist hugomd 4836cf96f0b62dd3a9e71c747c40b645 >}}

This will deploy Traefik to Kubernetes, and create a service that exposes it on ports 443, 80, and 8080.

Apply `deployment.yml`

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
```

Now we‚Äôll create a new file called `rbac.yml` which will give Traefik access to look for Ingresses:

{{< gist hugomd 30fc9d8bd5f5dd7b5506073d2e155422 >}}

Apply `rbac.yml`:

```
kubectl apply -f rbac.yml
```

Running `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`, you should see a line that looks like the following:

```
kube-system traefik-ingress-controller-6659bcdd46-7jh4l 1/1 Running
```

Notice `Running` and `1/1`‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif it appears as `ContainerCreating` or `0/1`, you‚Äôll have to give it a few moments to startup.

Now if we hit `k8s.local`, it should say load with `404 page not found`.

### Creating a deployment

We‚Äôll deploy `containous/whoami`, a neat little image which shows container information.

We‚Äôll create a file called `whoami-deployment.yml` which will consist of a deployment, a service, and an ingress:

{{< gist hugomd c5fb2b6719e20a7d3b77591ee36615e4 >}}

Now we can apply this:

```
kubectl apply -f whoami-deployment.yml
```

Now if you hit [https://whoami.k8s.local](https://whoami.k8s.local) it should pop up with container and host information, rather than that 404 we were seeing earlier!

You‚Äôve now got your very own local Kubernetes cluster, and a neat way to expose services over HTTPS!
