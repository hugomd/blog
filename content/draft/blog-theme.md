I've just updated this blog with a new fancy theme, one that I made myself this time. 

It's barebones, with no navigation, no tags listing and no author bio, although I can implement these whenever I get around to it.

I'm in the exam period and thought I'd take a short break to do this and don't want to waste anymore time on adding any extra stuff until after exams..

Expect to see the theme in all its terribly-written-code on Github in a few weeks.
