Torrenting. Is it illegal? Not necessarily. Is it legal then? That depends.

For those of you who don't know, torrents are used to share any number of files to friends or just people on the internet. The way this works is, if I send you a torrent so you can download 200 of my photos, that leaves you and me 'seeding' (uploading/sharing). Then, if you pass on the torrent to 'John', he will download from both of us. What this means is that his speed will be increased because we are both 'seeding' for him. Now, let's say you start download a set of 20GB files with 2000+ 'seeders' (people who are sharing), although 20GB is a lot, the download speed could get up to 30 to 50 MB/s (this depends on your network speed).

In short, torrenting allows for fast downloads of any number of different files.


**The Do's**


If you are downloading illegal torrents, its generally best to use a private torrent site. These sites often provide faster downloads and a guaranteed upload speed meaning that, no matter what files you're downloading, you'll be able to download them quickly. The second, and most important, reason to use a private torrent site is that they're 'trackers' (these track how many people are uploading or download) are secure meaning that you, most likely, won't be caught. The best feature of private torrent sites is that they are virus free.

Scan the files you've downloaded before extracting them (if they do happen to be zipped), you don't want a nasty virus. Viruses normally come from public torrent websites where malicious users want to feel like they're getting back at society.

Check the files you're downloading before you download them. Before you start downloading a torrent, in most torrent clients, a box will pop up showing you the files that are being downloaded. You'll want to look at these carefully to make sure you're downloading what you intended.

Check the comments. This is a must when using public torrents. This is where other users will comment on the quality of the torrent, be it video, audio or something else. They'll also comment with they're dislike upon finding out that the torrent contained viruses or that it wasn't what they thought it was, i.e. they tried downloading a movie that hadn't been released and were surprised to find it wasn't the movie they intended to download.


**The Don'ts**


Don't download anything illegal. Although anyone reading this will likely not be paying attention to the legality of what they're downloading, they should be aware of the consequences. The downloading illegal or copyrighted material can lead to a fine of up to 250,000 USD or a jail sentence of up to 5 years.

Don't try to download the latest and greatest. The chances are it'll be filled with viruses or will be of horrible quality. Wait until a few weeks (or months) after the movie has been released, then you'll be sure to get DVD rip or Bluray copy.

Don't post about it on Facebook. Firstly, no one cares. Secondly, it makes it easier for the police to find you.

If you follow the above when torrenting, you should be alright.
