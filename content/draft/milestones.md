Milestones are a concept worth contemplating, particularly in today's Western culture. Milestones are not goals, nor are they achievements. A goal is something to strive for, and goals, once reached, can continue, goal after goal. Achievements, once achieved, retain meaning, unlike goals, and remain cherished. Milestones are neither goals nor achievements, they represent only a moment passing, and once gone, mean very little.  

I say this, having recently turned 18, a pretty big milestone in Australia. At 18 I can drink alcohol, I can drive, I can go to bars and night clubs and I'm given more responsibility than I should have. Legally and socially, I have more responsiblity, while I personally feel as though nothing's changed. I could be 17 for all I know, I feel exactly the same.  

The reason for this blog post is to identify why I think milestones, especially Western ones, aren't such a great idea, even if they do hold traditional value, like 'coming of age'.  

Responsibility should be something that's given gradually, not something that's thrust upon individuals.
