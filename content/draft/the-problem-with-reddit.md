Reddit is much the same as 4chan. That might sound a little controversial but both sites allow for 'anonymous' posting, to a certain extent. Both have been used by 'hackers' to locate people that the majority of their users deem 'evil'. The University student that was [accused of the Boston bombing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22297568) is a prime example where Reddit may have gone a little too far. However, Reddit does have a lot to offer, its a diverse website that covers a wide range of topics. Atheism and Christianity, for instance, are seen as polar opposites but both have their own subreddits on the site.

Upon signing up to Reddit, each user is subscribed to a set of 'default' subreddits. This is a great way to welcome new users into the community and bring them content that the majority of users find interesting. However, the majority of this content, albeit interesting, is completely useless. Sure, [r/funny](http://reddit.com/r/funny/) is hilarious at times, as can [r/gaming](http://reddit.com/r/gaming/) or [r/videos](http://reddit.com/r/videos/). 

There is a solution to the 'default' subreddits, having 'supra' reddits (the opposite of 'sub') allowing you to subscribe to a category of subreddits, ones that are entertaining, like 'funny', ones that are useful, like 'LifeProTips', etc. 

The default subreddits are distracting. I've unsubscribed from most of them and, instead, have subscribed to a whole heap of very interesting (intellectually) subreddits and rid myself of funny, gaming, videos, and WTF.
