Surprisingly, I spend a lot of money on subscriptions every year.  
Unsurprisingly, I haven't tallied how much I actually spend, partly because I'm 
a little lazy and partly because I'm scared of finding out exactly how much I 
spend.. So here it is...

## Monthly Expenditures
### [Google Play Music & YouTube Red](https://music.google.com/)
I pay $5.99 AUD per month for Google Play Music, now inclusive of YouTube Red, 
as I paid for several months in advance when they went on sale quite recently 
(as of 28/05/2016), but I'll be going back to $9.99 AUD a month in August.

While I can't say I listen to a _lot_ of music, it's nice to be able to listen 
to pretty much anything thing I want whenever I want, and it's definitely 
worth the cost. I've tried a few other streaming services but have always 
ended up coming back to GPM because 1) it has all of my music already and 2) I 
can upload any music that _isn't_ already there, something that many, if not 
all, other streaming services lack. 

### [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/music/)
I'm transitioning to Apple Music, still on their 3 month trial, but will end up 
paying $5.99 thanks to their student discount. I'm still not sure that I'll be 
going through with the switch from Google Music, it really depends on the 
upcoming changes [announced at 
WWDC](http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11903956/apple-music-update-itunes-redesign-announced-wwdc-2016).

### [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com/)
I pay $10.00 USD per month for two DigitalOcean droplets, running around 10 
fairly small websites. It's cheap, and I like the freedom of taking snapshots 
and backups, and all that good stuff that comes with DigitalOcean. In fact, 
this blog is hosted on one of the servers. 

While $10.00 USD isn't particularly much for servers, it does add up, and I've 
been planning to migrate from DO to some Docker containers running on my 
Online.net server (next in this list).

### [Online.net](https://www.online.net/en)
I pay â‚¬15.99 EUR for a fairly [beefy 
server](https://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/dedibox-xc) which I 
currently use to host a number of Docker containers, including a [GitLab 
CE](https://about.gitlab.com) instance, a number of [GitLab CI 
runners](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) and a rtorrent/rutorrent.

This server was my first foray into the world of Docker, and I'm hoping to 
dockerize  most of my stuff and move it there.

### [Amaysim](https://www.amaysim.com.au/)
Most people have phone plans. I'm one of those people. I pay $39.90 AUD per 
month for 7 GB of data, unlimited calls and texts, and some access to 
international call/text subject to higher rates (which I don't use). 

I find I rarely use up more than 5 GB each month, but it's nice knowing I have 
the extra data just in case.

### [Netflix](https://netflix.com/)
I currently have a subscription, which I'm paying $11.99 AUD per month for, 
but I'm planning to cancel because I don't find myself using it _that_ often 
(blasphemous, I know!).

### [Animelab](https://animelab.com/)
I thoroughly enjoy anime, and I find that I keep coming back for more each 
season. Animelab is the easiest way for me to watch them, is super fast and has 
an amazing user interface and keeps up to date with simulcasts. This runs me a 
neat $6.99 AUD per month.
