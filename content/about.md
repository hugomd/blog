Hi, I'm Hugo ðŸ‘‹.

I live in Melbourne, Australia, and I'm a software engineer at <span class="cashapp functional"><a href="https://cash.app">Cash App</a></span>.


I {{%sidenote "~~avoid~~ love coffee" %}}But I did go through a zero-caffeine phase, so now I'm a rather moderate coffee drinker.{{% /sidenote %}}, tweet occasionally, have a few interesting side projects, and <i>try</i> to do open source.

To get a better idea of what I've been working on, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/hugomd).

If you like any of my projects, or posts on this blog, please do let me know via email or Twitter, I'd love to hear from you!

# About this website

This blog is built with a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (I wrote about it [here](/post/moving-to-cloudflare-pages/)).

I'm using a [custom theme](https://github.com/hugomd/blog/tree/develop/themes/simple) which I wrote myself. Maybe one day I'll release it as its own project, but it still needs a little work before that happens.

My domain was purchased through [host.md](https://host.md/) (formerly known as Molddata), I think this is the main registrar for `.md` domains.

I manage DNS for `hugo.md` via Cloudflare.

I write my posts in [neovim](https://neovim.io/), and push them to my [blog repository](https://github.com/hugomd/blog) on GitHub, where they are automatically deployed.
