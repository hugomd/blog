title: "About me"

Hi, I'm Hugo ðŸ‘‹.

  I live in Melbourne, Australia, and I'm a software engineer at <span class="cashapp functional"><a href="https://cash.app">Cash App</a></span> <img class="icon" src='/img/cash-app-icon.svg' />


I avoid caffeine, tweet, have a few interesting side projects, and _try_ to do open source.

If you like any of my projects, or posts on this blog, please do let me know via email or Twitter, I'd love to hear from you!

# About this website

This blog is built with a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (I wrote about it [here](/post/moving-to-cloudflare-pages/)).

I'm using the [TBD theme](https://github.com/hugomd/blog/tree/develop/themes/simple), which I wrote myself.

My domain was purchased through [host.md](https://host.md/) (previously Molddata), I think this is the main registrar for `.md` domains.

I manage DNS for `hugo.md` via Cloudflare.

I write my posts in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and push them to my [blog repository](https://github.com/hugomd/blog) on GitHub, where they are automatically deployed.
